      "Our church property spans 2.5 acres and was overrun with tall dry grass, tumbleweeds, and a ton of wood chips. We were worried about potentially getting a ticket from the city. Doug came by, assessed the situation, and provided a fair bid for the job. He went above and beyond in his work, and we couldn’t be happier with the results and the price. Honestly, it seems like he might have lost money on this job, but the outcome is fantastic. Our property looks great, and we no longer have to worry about any city violations. Thank you, Doug! You’re awesome!",

      "Doug’s Tractor Works did an amazing job in my backyard.  I own a 2.5 acre property that had weeds over six feet tall. After Doug as done my backyard looked amazing. He mowed down all the tall weeds that were so thick you couldn’t even walk through my backyard.  Doug’s Tractor Works was extremely professional and so helpful. I highly recommend his company to anyone needing tractor work done. Thank you very much for your professional services.",
